# Django ToDo list

This is a to-do list web application with the basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).

## Task

Create a Kubernetes manifest for a pod that will contain a ToDo app container:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Modify pod manifest to deploy a second same pod with a different name.
1. Add labels to pods “app: todolist”
1. Create a manifest for a ClusterIP service, which should balance traffic between two pods
1. Create a manifest for a NodePort service, which should expose an application on a Node Level
1. Set all env values for the container from the pod’s manifest
1. Create the `INSTRUCTION.md` file
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` should contain instructions on how to test an app by calling a ClusterIP service DNS from a busybox container
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` file should contain instructions on how to test ToDo application using the service `port-forward` command
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` should contain instructions on how to access an app using a NodePort Service
1. Create PR with your changes and attach it for validation on a platform.


## How to test

1. Apply manifests:

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./infrasctructure/
```

2. Test the app by calling a ClusterIP service DNS from a busybox container:

    2.1. Open a busybox container shell:
    ```shell
    kubectl exec -n todoapp -it busybox -- sh
    ```
    
    2.2. Run a command to test the app:
    ```shell
    curl http://todoapp-clusterip-service.todoapp.svc.cluster.local
    ```

3. Test ToDo application using the service `port-forward` command:

    3.1. Run a command to forward the port:
    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n todoapp service/todoapp-clusterip-service 8080:80
    ```
    
    3.2. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080


4. Access an app using a NodePort Service: Open a browser and go to http://localhost:30008
